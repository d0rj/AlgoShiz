# AlgoShiz

## Description 

A repository that implements various algorithms, data structures, useful functions and classes. 

The main purpose is to save them for quick search in the future and the practice of writing code.

## Repo structure

For convenience, there is a breakdown into categories:

1. **Math**

    Algorithms are located here, mostly related to computational mathematics. However, there are also popular simple algorithms.

2. **Arrays**

    Here are just useful functions for working with arrays.

3. **Sorts**

    Category for sorting. Here are quite a few different popular and not very sortings, most of which have an estimate of the computational complexity of the algorithm in the description.

4. **Search**

    Search algorithms in an array or in a string.

5. **Structures**

    Implementations of popular data structures.

6. ***Events**

    A separate category for the implementation of events similar to those in C #.
